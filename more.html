                <h1 class="headings">Music <br> Lover</h1>
                <p>I am a huge fan of music. Since childhood, I always like to listen to songs whether what kind of genre that song is. Now, I am particularly listening more on a Kpop genre. Actually I am stanning Blackpink, a South Korean Girl Group who paved its way on the global scale of music influence. Let me share you my favorite song; 12:51 by Krissy and Ericka, Pecfect Two by Auburn, Bet You Wanna by Blackpink, By Chance by JRA, and A Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carlton.</p>

                <p>The world of fantasy got caught my attention. Reading a masterpiece that can take you to different places when you are just sitting. Harry Potter book series, books that shaped my childhood that got me into liking reading books. Engaging with fantasy can stimulate creativity and boost vocabulary. It helped me develop better self-regulation skills.</p>
